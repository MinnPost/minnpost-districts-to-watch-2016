State Representative District 2A,"The House district that covers the Lake of the Woods area and the northernmost tip of the the state is known for its volatility. Since 2010, it’s flipped from Republican to Democratic and back to Republican again. This cycle, DFLers hope the cycle continues, especially after incumbent GOP Rep. Dave Hancock decided to step down. They’ve recruited Jerry Loud, who has worked for 10 years with the Red Lake Band of Chippewa in the district. Republicans are running Matthew Grossell, a retired Clearwater County sheriff's deputy. But expect voters to hear about Loud’s 30-year-old divorce ruling, where he was found to have battered his wife. "
State Representative District 5B,"Last cycle, Republicans spent a ton of money to try and chip away at DFL Rep. Tom Anzelc’s popularity in his Bemidji-area district, but to no avail. He easily held onto his seat in a tough year for the DFL. This year, they’ve recruited a well-known candidate in Sandy Layman, a former head of the Iron Range Resources and Rehabilitation Board (IRRRB). On top of that, Green Party candidate Dennis Barsness is also seeking the seat, and Republicans hope he ultimately siphons off votes from Anzelc. Republicans also say there could be a “Trump factor” in the district, as the wild card Republican nominee’s message seems to play well with disgruntled working-class voters in northern Minnesota. "
State Representative District 10B,"Losing an Aitkin-area legislative seat hurt for the DFL in 2014, on several levels. First, the district leans Republican, but Democrats managed to sweep it up in the 2012 election. Second, they did so with Joe Radinovich, a young, rising-star politician who made a big splash when he voted in favor of legalizing gay marriage in his first term, despite the socially conservative swing of his district. That vote might have cost him his seat in the 2014 election. But with a boost in turnout from the presidential election, Democrats are hoping to take the seat back with Erin Wagner, a teacher who has worked at multiple schools in the district. Wagner’s big issues are education and the environment, but Republicans think her opposition to the PolyMet copper-nickel mining project will hurt her campaign in the district. "
State Representative District 11B,"The 2016 election will be a major test of how reliably conservative Greater Minnesota, particularly the central part of the state, has become over the last several years. The race for a Mora-area House seat is another one that has flipped back and forth with the changing political winds, and Democrats hope it will flip again this fall with Tom Jones, a Kanabec County contractor and small business owner. "
State Representative District 12A,"Democrats are setting up a handful of rematches in the battle for the House this year, and that includes a do-over between GOP Rep. Jeff Backer and former DFL Rep. Jay McNamar. McNamar lost by about 700 votes in 2014, but Democrats point to his strong ties to the community. McNamar was an Elbow Lake fireman for 20 years and served as the city’s mayor. Republicans want to maintain the ground the picked up in rural Minnesota in 2014, making this a key race to watch. "
State Representative District 14B,"In St. Cloud Minnesota, incumbent GOP Rep. Jim Knoblach is in a close race that could cost House Republicans their chief budget guru. After previously serving in the House in the 1990s and early 2000s, Knoblach was re-elected to the chamber by just 60 votes votes in 2014. His previous experience in the House prompted Republicans, also newly in the majority, to place him as the powerful Ways and Means Committee chairman. But his opponent in 2014, former DFL Rep. Zachary Dorholt, is running again, and this year he’ll have boosted voter turnout at his back, especially in a town with a large public university. Expect Republicans to work hard to defend Knoblach, making this one of the most-watched — and expensive — races in the House this cycle. "
State Representative District 17A,"Andrew Falk felt a steady stream of negative advertisements and mailers from outside groups suppressed turnout in 2014 and helped Republicans cast him out of his House seat, which he held for six years. Heavy spending and negative ads are unlikely to stop this year in his rematch with GOP Rep. Tim Miller, but turnout should be buoyed by the presidential race. The district did pick Romney over Obama in 2012, which is why some operatives think it will lean Republican again in 2016. Last session, Miller took a lead role promoting the re-opening of a private prison in Appleton, which has made him popular in the district, but expect Falk to talk about his support for the project as well. "
State Representative District 17B,"The race for a Willmar-area House seat is another rematch from 2014. Two years ago, Republican businessman and political newcomer Dave Baker beat incumbent DFL Rep. Mary Sawatzky by less than one percentage point. This year, Sawatzky is hoping to win her seat back with much higher turnout. A teacher, Sawatzky will talk about bringing the same education opportunities metro students get to rural communities. Baker stood out in his first-term as a lawmaker willing to work across party lines, authoring legislation to require doctors and physicians to track patients and what opioids they are being prescribed. "
State Representative District 21A,"Tim Kelly fit his Red Wing House district well. He was a moderate Republican with a reputation for breaking away from his caucus, easily winning re-election after his first victory in 2008. But with his retirement from the Legislature this year, Democrats see an opportunity: The district voted for Obama over Romney in  2012, and they’ve recruited Lisa Bayley, a member of the Red Wing City Council for the last eight years. But Republicans are pretty happy with their recruit, too: Barb Haley, a lifelong Red Wing resident and businesswoman who volunteers in the community. "
State Representative District 24B,"Patti Fritz served for a decade as a moderate Democrat in her conservative-leaning Faribault House district before she was knocked off in the GOP rural wave of 2014 by Republican newcomer Brian Daniels. Daniels has a record now, after serving one term in St. Paul, and Democrats hope they can use it to bring Fritz back to St. Paul. In particular, Fritz will talk about gridlock that blocked a transportation and bonding package from passing this spring."
State Representative District 25B,"Kim Norton made history — in several ways — when she won her Rochester House seat back in 2006. Not only was she the first woman ever represent the district, she was also the first Democrat elected in the northern Rochester seat in decades. But she’s retiring this fall, and the big question is how much has Rochester changed since Norton was first elected. Many think it’s become more reliably Democratic since then, but Republicans want to put that assumption to the test. They’ve recruited former GOP Rep. Fran Bradley, who held the seat before Norton in 2004. Duane Sauke, a retired realtor, is running as a Democrat. "
State Representative District 27A,"On paper, incumbent GOP Rep. Peggy Bennett is in for an incredibly tough time to maintain her Albert Lea-area House seat this fall. The district leans far Democratic in presidential years, and Democrats have recruited Gary Schindler, the dean of student affairs at Riverland Community College. They also like their chances with a candidate from Albert Lea, the district’s main population center. But Bennett was a popular schoolteacher in the district for 33 years, making this a less-than-definite pickup for Democrats. With two education-focused candidates, expect education funding and college tuition costs to be the big issues on the campaign trail this fall. "
State Representative District 48A,"This Minnetonka-area House seat might be one of the purest competitive seats in the state. No matter what the electoral situation is — a presidential year or an off year — the race is always decided by just a handful of votes. DFL Rep. Yvonne Selcer won it by just 1 percentage point back in 2012 and held on to it by even less in 2014 — just 41 votes. With Selcer retiring this year, it makes the seat even more competitive. Republicans have endorsed Mary Shapiro, a former Minneapolis School teacher. She will have to beat Republican candidate Kris Newcomer in an Aug. 9 primary to make it on the general election ballot, where the winner will go up against Laurie Pryor, a longtime DFL activist in the district.  "
State Representative District 50B,"The Bloomington House seat was long held by Democrats until February, when Republican newcomer Chad Anderson beat Bloomington City Council Member Andrew Carlson in a special election. The election was a short sprint with a fair amount of outside campaigning from Republicans, who highlighted a vote on the council from Carlson to impose new regulations on garbage collection. Republicans said the victory is a sign they can play in Minnesota’s suburbs this fall, but Democrats expect it was a low-turnout special election fluke. On paper, this is a clear pick up for Democrats this fall, but expect Republicans to hit him for the same issues they did during the special election campaign. "
State Representative District 56B,"Roz Peterson ran twice before she secured her place in the Minnesota House, representing parts of Burnsville and Lakeville. Her victory in 2014 was the only Republican gain made in the suburbs. This year, she’s fighting a DFL wave taking over the region, possibly for good.  She’s also going up against Lindsey Port, a favorite among DFL recruits this year, who lives and owns a small business in Burnsville. "
State Senator District 1,"Part of the recipe for Democrats long control of the state Senate is a handful of popular incumbents who’ve managed to hold on to rural districts that naturally lean conservative. DFL Sen. LeRoy Stumpf held his Republican-leaning northern Minnesota Senate seat since 1982, but his retirement puts it back in play this fall. Republicans endorsed Mark Johnson, an attorney from East Grand Forks. Democrats like their chances with endorsed-candidate Kip Fontaine, a public defender from Red Lake Falls. "
State Senator District 14,"St. Cloud residents will be inundated with campaign ads and mailers this fall with two competitive legislative races in the area, including an open seat in the Senate. Republican Sen. John Pederson is retiring after two terms, and his party has recruited Jerry Relph, a small business owner in the district with a similar profile as Pederson. Democrats have recruited Dan Wolgamott, a young real estate agent who made an unsuccessful bid for the more conservative part of the district in the House last cycle. "
State Senator District 21,"Matt Schmit has a reputation as a hard campaigner in his Red Wing-area Senate district, but he’s facing the ballot for the first time since he was first elected in 2012, a good year for Democrats. The district has swung back and forth over the years, and Republicans have recruited Mike Goggins, a union member who works at a power plant in the district. The Goggin name is strong in the area, according to Republicans, as his father used to run the Red Wing Shoe Company. Schmit served on the transportation conference committee this spring, and expect him to talk about the failure of Republicans to reach a deal on a long-term funding plan. "
State Senator District 24,"John Jasinski is one of several Republican recruits this cycle in the so-called “Mayor’s Club.” Jasinski is the two-term Mayor of Faribault and a former city council member, and Republicans are excited about his popularity in the district’s main population center. But Jasinski is going up against incumbent Sen. Vicki Jensen, a moderate Democrat and former Owatonna School Board Member who runs an insurance agency in the district. "
State Senator District 36,"The Senate district that covers suburban cities like Champlin and Brooklyn Park is typically a competitive seat, but the Republicans think their recruit this year gives them the advantage. Jeff Lunde is mayor of Brooklyn Park, a part of the district Republicans usually struggle to pick up votes. But Incumbent Sen. John Hoffman is a former member of the Anoka-Hennepin School Board and expect Democrats to fight to keep him in the Senate. "
State Senator District 37,"DFL Sen. Alice Johnson’s retirement from her suburban Senate seat has made it a target for Republicans this fall. They’ve Recruited Brad Sanford, a banker and youth sports coach in the district who is taking his first step into the political world. He’ll run against an experienced lawmaker in Jerry Newton, a teacher who has represented one-half of the district in the House since 2008. But it’s a competitive district, split in the House between Democrats and Republicans. "
State Senator District 44,"DFL Sen. Terri Bonoff is on to bigger things this election cycle, making a run at the 3rd Congressional District and incumbent GOP U.S. Rep. Erik Paulsen. That leaves open a competitive Minnetonka-area seat that Bonoff first won in a special election in 2005. She held on to the swing seat over the years with a moderate tone and business-friendly positions on everything from tax increases to the minimum wage. To replace Bonoff, Democrats have recruited Deb Calvert, a former Sen. Amy Klobuchar staffer who now works in the dean’s office at Mitchell Hamline School of Law. But Republicans are excited about their candidate, Paul Anderson, a well-known Republican activist who previously served as a deputy chief of staff for former Gov. Tim Pawlenty. Moderation and a business-friendly message will win the day in this swing district. "
State Senator District 53,"Boosted by voter turnout in 2012, DFL newcomer Susan Kent knocked off Republican Ted Lillie for a Woodbury-area Senate seat. Since then, Kent has emerged as one of the more prominent members of the Senate freshman class. With turnout boosted by the presidential race this year, Democrats hope they can keep Kent in the Senate. But Republicans are excited about their candidate, Sharna Wahlgren, a lawyer in the district who ran for Congress against DFL U.S. Rep. Betty McCollum in 2014. Kent has led on transportation and education issues, and recently took up the talks of trying to legalize Sunday liquor sales in her Wisconsin bordering district. "
State Senator District 48,"Senate District 48 in Eden Prairie was an dead even split between Obama and Romney in 2012, and the House districts are represented by both a Republican and a Democrat. In the Senate, Republican Minority Leader David Hann holds the seat and has for the last 15 years. That’s not stopping Democrats from targeting his seat this fall with recruit Steve Cwodzinski, a popular American Government teacher in Eden Prairie High School who retired just this year. In particular, Democrats hope Trump’s unpopularity in the suburbs and support for a DFL-backed Southwest Light Rail Transit project will tip the race over into their control. "
State Senator District 57,"Greg Clausen was swept into the Senate in the DFL wave of 2012, but he now holds a suburban seat with a long Republican history. The district covers parts of Apple Valley, Rosemount and Lakeville, which tend to trend conservative. Republicans have recruited small business owner Cory Campbell to try and win the district back, but Democrats feel good about Clausen, a leader on education issues in the chamber."
